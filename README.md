# List Iterator

This repo contains code to demonstrate how an iterator works.  You can compile and run the test code as follows:

```
make
./test
```
The code as it's initially written generates compiler errors because the linked list implementation is well encapsulated.  We'll modify the code to add an iterator that will enable us to loop through a linked list.
